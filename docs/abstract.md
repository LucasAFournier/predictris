## Abstract

Artificial agents now outperform humans on many visual and linguistic benchmarks, yet their abilities remain case‑specific due in part to the absence of action‑grounded structure central to human cognition. This gap suggests that perception, action, and prediction must form a tightly coupled feedback loop and that perception be reframed not as passive stimulus reception, but as an active process emerging from the mastery of **sensorimotor contingencies**—systematic relationships between actions and their perceptual consequences [@oregan2001].

We thus ask: *Can a simple, online structure capture meaningful sensorimotor regularities and foster autonomous object discovery through prediction alone?*  
We explore this by proposing a minimalist memory mechanism that incrementally builds predictive sequences based on sensorimotor experience.
